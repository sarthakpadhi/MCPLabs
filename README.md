This is a demo for using MCP. The purpose was the create a MCP server and client that would tell me the weather of a US state and alert me if there is any extreme forecasts. 

Novelty : I rewrote the code to use OpenAI's APIs instead of anthropic. 

This uses a STDIO transport layer and a FASTMCP to create the server
